# Example application to learn how to authenticate users in sails
Simple Nodejs + Sailsjs application that allows to post messages to authenticated users.

## Doing it yourself
### Setting up the environment
1. Install nodejs (https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install sails (remember to use admin rights when open CMD, I'm using windows)

	```sh
	$ npm -g install sails
	```
	
3. Create a new sails project

	```sh
	$ sails new simple-post-messages-sails
	```
	
4. Start the app

	```sh
	$ cd simple-post-messages-sails
	$ sails lift
	```

5. Go to http://localhost:1337/

Nothing new, that is the staring guide from sails (http://sailsjs.org/get-started)
